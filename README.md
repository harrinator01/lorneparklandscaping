Creating a SQL database from my old landscaping business's spreadsheets


I was looking for potential data projects and one idea that excited me was to create a "Spotify Wrapped" based on my old lanscaping business data. 

When I was running the business, I wasn't as experienced or focused on our data systems. It wasn't super important at the time as we didn't usually have more than four employees working at any one time. As a result, the data was just stored in spreadsheets (which of course changed formats over time). 

My plan is essentially to create something that could scale from four concurrent employees to forty, four hundred, four thousand etc. 

After examining the old spreadsheets, I've created a more sensible data structure and transformed much of the data into said structure.
I then took those new tables and imported them into MySQL and started running queries to see what I could learn for a "Lorne Park Landscaping Wrapped".
